# Learn You A Python

This is the top-level intro page for an expanding series of lessons on how to use Python. This file is called `README.md` and is formatted using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## How to use these lessons

### Intro

Start with the 000_intro directory (you may be accustomed to calling these "folders" as well, but in general, we will call them directories here.) There you'll find yet another `README.md`. This is a pattern you'll see repeated throughout these lessons, as well as in most Github projects you'll interact with. Always look for a `README` or `README.md` file in a project, which should explain how to use the rest of the files in that directory.

Follow the instructions in the Intro `README.md` to get your environment set up properly. Your instructions will be different based on whether you're using Linux, ChromeOS, Windows, or OSX.

### Other Lessons

If you're new to programming, you'll have the easiest time proceeding through the lessons if you go in order. Some lessons will build on what you have learned in the past.

If you're coming from another programming language, you can probably skip straight to Section 008 or so. However, if you get there and feel like you're missing something, it can't hurt to go back and work through earlier examples.

### About This Guide

I've built this because of how many friends tell me they want to learn Python but "don't know how to get started." Everyone learns differently, and for some folks it's best to watch a video, or take a class, or just open up a Python REPL and start hacking and reading docs.

My hope is that this is one more option for a certain kind of learner to get their feet in the water, with a little guidance, and still have lots of room and tools to splash around. If you run out of lessons and have a suggestion for what you'd like to learn next, you can always open an issue against this repository!

There may be mistakes in here, or places where you have a suggestion on language or information that would have helped you more. If you find one, send me a pull request! I'm not fussy.

Happy Hacking!
