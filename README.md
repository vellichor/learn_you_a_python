# Learn You A Python

This is the top-level intro page for an expanding series of lessons on how to use Python. This file is called `README.md` and is formatted using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## How to use these lessons

### Intro

Start with the 000_intro directory (you may be accustomed to calling these "folders" as well, but in general, we will call them directories here.) There you'll find yet another `README.md`. This is a pattern you'll see repeated throughout these lessons, as well as in most Github projects you'll interact with. Always look for a `README` or `README.md` file in a project, which should explain how to use the rest of the files in that directory.

Follow the instructions in the Intro `README.md` to get your environment set up properly. Your instructions will be different based on whether you're using Linux, ChromeOS, Windows, or OSX.

### Other lessons

If you're new to programming, you'll have the easiest time proceeding through the lessons if you go in order. Some lessons will build on what you have learned in the past.

If you're coming from another programming language, you can probably skip straight to Section 010 or so. However, if you get there and feel like you're missing something, it can't hurt to go back and work through earlier examples.
